    <h2>Take Away 1: His Journaling Skill.</h2>
    <section class="journal">
      <h3>Why should we journal?</h3>
      <p>
        <q>Thinking in our mind is mostly like writing with a vapouring ink.</q>
        Our course of daily actions are dictated by our thoughts --> which in
        terms are dictated by the environment and our past experiences. Our
        environment keeps streaming gigabits of data to our sensors, which our
        mind keeps processing. If we live like this it will be like --
        <q> Living on a daily basis, solving same problems everyday.</q>. While
        it is necessary and unavoidable, to value ourself in human society we
        should achieve difficult goals -- which is a long time affair involving
        consistency,self-discipline. We should have a rough idea where we want
        to be after a month,quarter,year and decade, of course we course correct
        along the way but we will reach somewhere near to that
        <em> rough idea of ours</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So in this data driven world -- we should have the data of our past
        thoughts,emotions and actions, so that we can update ourself accordingly
        -- avoiding common pitfalls, automating daily rituals aka.
        <em>self-disciplining ourself</em>
        We must do some version of following things.
      </p>

      <h3>What we learned from his journals?</h3>
      <p>
          <ul>
              <li>Where to focus on what time ? Breaking day into larger chunks of time and focusing on set of actions to do one larger task  ---> Actions to perform tasks --> Tasks to reach goals.</li>
              <li>Improve your systems i.e the way of doing things -- so it can be reapplied to similar actions.</li>
              <li>Instead of mastering one skill in short period of time -- from big picture break it down into modules and proceed step by step on daily basis till mastery. After that find another endower. </li>
              <li>Self reflect on ourself -- Why we worry? What valuable work I'm performing ? What are the motives behind my actions ? </li>
              <li>What good shall I do this day?</li>
          </ul>
